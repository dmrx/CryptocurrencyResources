<p>On Feb 23, 2017, <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html">Google</a> and news agencies like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-team-cracks-longtime-pillar-of-internet-security-1487854804">WSJ</a> published a startling find! Researchers from the <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/news/2017/cwi-and-google-announce-first-collision-industry-security-standard-sha-1">CWI Institute in Amsterdam</a> and Google were successful in generating a hash collision with <strong>SHA-1</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.deltadeltaandmoredeltas.com/cryptographichashfunction/">Collision</a> means that two different messages when hashed separately had the same hash.02Hashing is converting a document that may be like 5MB to a 40 digit number. If you&#8217;re thinking, why hasn&#8217;t a collision been found earlier? Compressing a document to only 40 digits means that eventually there would a collision. Eventually yes but, 40 digits is a huge number and thus impractical randomly. Thus being able to engineer a collision in astonishing, a huge technical feat!</p>
<p>What these researchers were able to do is find a collision in almost 100,000 times faster than a strict brute force attack. Yes, they leveraged Google&#8217;s tremendous cloud infrastructure to do so but the point remains is they did it. That means others will say <strong>Watch me too!</strong>. The attack required over a lot of computations (9,223,372,036,854,775,808) i.e. 9 quintillion i.e. 6,500 years of single-CPU computations or 110 years of single-GPU computations. If someone wanted to replicate it, they likely could and Google says this is likely within a month. Appropriately, Google has provided this free detection link <a href="http://shattered.io/">here</a> that one can use to better understand the attack and ways to mitigate it.</p>
<p>The <strong>impact</strong> of this find is that an attacker could submit a malicious document that has the same hash as a benign one.02SHA-1 is not some simple hash function. Because SHA-1 has been used for certificate verification or validation of documents, having someone break this system is disturbing. SHA-1 has been used for browser security and code management. GIT and SVN do use SHA-1. From <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvalds-on-sha-1-and-git-the-sky-isnt-falling/">ZDNet </a>, at least the creators of Git do not think it is a huge concern. However, they mention that Git will be sunsetting SHA-1.</p>
<p>For most browsers though, they key word would be <strong>&#8220;has been&#8221;</strong> as Google Chrome has been sunsetting uses of SHA-1 for several years and same with Firefox. There was a wake-up call in 2005 when researchers in China found a theoretical method to find a collision which prompted people in the industry starting to shift hash functions. Now in Feb 2017, Google and CWI Institute have proven it in the practical sense. Bitcoin uses a SHA-256 hash function. More of the concern for bitcoin would be that the source code is all in Git but again, at least the creators of Git say &#8220;Don&#8217;t Worry&#8221;.</p>
